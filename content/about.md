# About

HAPPIH is an association that emerged following a contest sponsored by the government of Monaco. Broadly, HAPPIH aims to reduce gender inequality in different regions of the world such as the Maghreb and Europe. Currently, HAPPIH is conducting activities in Morocco and France. HAPPIH's current projects aim to distribute re-usable pads in order to ensure that women and young girls from lower classes have access to the same opportunities as their male counterparts without being limited by their menstruation cycle.

Between the 15th and 17th of December, the HAPPIH team lead its first project in the Marrakech region. Throughout the three days, the teams has met 125 girls from lower class families and gave every girl a re-usable sanitary pad. The distribution was also accompanied with a meeting with every family. The meetings aimed to inform the families about female hygiene practices and encourage the families to keep their daughters schooled.

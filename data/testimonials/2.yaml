text: "Five Sciences Po Paris students are launching in the Marrakech region the first part of their pilot project, “Humanitarian Action for Protection and Preservation of Intimacy Hygiene” (HAPPIH), which unravels the subject of periods. A pilot project in Morocco undertaken by Charles Culioli, Walid Ben Hamadi, Moez Rais, Rita Sekkat and Denizalp Goktas, from different countries including the kingdom. Their aim is to support vulnerable children in Morocco, address the taboo subject of menstruation, and thus change mentalities. The campaign came along with a distribution of washable sanitary towel kits for girls in a boarding school near south of Marrakech."
